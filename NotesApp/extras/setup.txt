This file contains the instructions on how to setup and run this application.
After successfull setup, I am expected it to run at http://localhost:8080/NotesApp/api/notes

A) Setup Sqlite3 embedded database:
	1) Go to https://www.sqlite.org/download.html and get the binaries for particular OS. For my case, I used Window (x64). 
        2) Unzip it to some folder. In my case C:\sqlite.
	3) Add this directory to PATH.  Now you can execute sqlite3 from any directory.
        4) create directory where you want your sqlite DB to reside. In my case: C:\Users\Sandeep.Kinra\DB.
        5) using cmd/terminal window, go to directory in step 4, and type sqlite3 lb.db
        6) After executing step 5, it will create lb.db database. Then type at .databases
        7) After step 6, you can see the lb.db. Now execute the following to create table:
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS NOTES(
 		ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY     NOT NULL,
 		BODY TEXT	NOT NULL
		); 

        8) Adter step 7, table NOTES is created. Type .tables  You will see name of table NOTES
        9)  Now your sqlite setup is completed.

B) Install Tomcat 9
C) From extra directory, copy sqlite-jdbc.3.23.1.jar to your tomcat/lib directory
D) I have added only basic logging to catch errors. PLease add the following in tomcat/conf/logging.properties
   com.lb.notes.doa = INFO 
   com.lb.notes.doa.handlers = 1catalina.org.apache.juli.AsyncFileHandler

   This will write JDBC erros to catalina.log file.

E) In target folder there is .war file. Before we put this .war file into tomcat/webapps/ROOT directory, we need to make few changes:

   Using 7zip, open archive this file. Copy context.xml file from META-INF to some other location. Open the context.xml file, and update 
   url value. Currently it reference the location of sqllite DB as menioned in Step A, 4. Update to whatever location/name you've created.
   Save it and put this file back to open archive.

F) Now put this updated .war file in tomcat ROOT directory and start the tomcat. 
   Hopefully everything is running at http://localhost:8080/NotesApp/api/notes  If not, please contact me.

G) PLease see the file testcase.txt in extra folder. Those are the test cases I ran.
